# BRANCHING AND MERGING

Branching off of main..
git branch [branch-name]

When adding something like a new feature, we branch it from main. 
Main will still be maintained and fixed while the feature is being worked on.
Once the feature is completely developed, the new version can be merged into the maiin brannch again.

git merge [branch-name]

main:      1---2---3---4---5
           |   \     /
feature 1: |    3---4
           \
feature 2:  2---3---4
