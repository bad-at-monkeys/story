…or create a new repository on the command line
echo # test >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m first commit
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/bad-at-monkeys/test.git
git push -u origin main

…or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/bad-at-monkeys/test.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

git status
git log

..we can check the diff between versions —
git diff test.txt

..to revert back to a previous version —
git checkout test.txt

..to check which remote repositories are —
git remote -v

The process will typically go:
  working dir -> staging -> local repo -> remote repo
        git add  -->  git commit  -->  git push

To remove staged files —
git rm --cached -r
